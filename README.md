# IoTEggBLE-Android

This example demonstrates how to use the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) to transmit sensor data between ICS IoT Egg and Android. 

The IoT Egg is an integrated sensor suite which has been developed by Institute for Communication Systems (ICS) http://www.surrey.ac.uk/ics/, University of Surrey. At its core is an ARM Cortex M3 microprocessor (LPC1768). For more information of IoT Egg, please contact Professor Klaus Moessner <k.moessner@surrey.ac.uk> or Dr. William Headley <w.headley@surrey.ac.uk>

Temperature and humidity values are receiving from IoTEgg Device (https://github.com/beyondbest/IoTEggBLE-Device/) via BLE. And it can change the RGB LED color by transmitting LED value to IoTEgg Device via BLE.
